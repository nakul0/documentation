To keep the economy stable and prevent people from hoarding credits, there is a tax system in place that will automatically reduce your credits every 1st of the month. This system is needed as otherwise tons of credits flow into the economy whilst only a small fraction of that is actually spend. This would cause massive inflation and ruin the bot's economy, which is why this tax system is setup.

Since only the rich people get taxed you are probably not affected, but if you have more than 100k credits you will pay a small percentage each month based on the following rules:

- 0-100k: 0%
- 100k-1mil: 7%
- 1mil+: 13%

So, if you have less than 100k credits you are unaffected. If you have 200k credits, you pay 0% over the first 100k and 7% over the other 100k, meaning you pay 100k * 0.07 = 7k per month.

If you have 1.5 million then you do NOT pay 13% over the 1.5 million. You pay 0% over the first 100k, then 7% over the next 900k and 13% over the last 500k (similar to how tax works in real life).
