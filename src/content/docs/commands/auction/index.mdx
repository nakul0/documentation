Unlike market, auction works by bidding on Pokémon. It ends after a certain time or after the bid goal is reached.
If you are looking for a Pokémon to buy, use \`/auction search\` (and use the filters) to find a Pokémon you want.
After finding the Pokémon you want, use \`/auction view\` to view the Pokémon in detail.
If you like the Pokémon want to bid on it, use \`/auction bid\` to bid on it.

If you want to sell your Pokémon, use \`/auction create\` to sell your Pokémon.
You can set the duration and the Pokémon will be listed on the auction for other players to bid.
To view all your Pokémon for sale on the auction, use \`/auction listings\`!
